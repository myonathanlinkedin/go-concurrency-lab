# Sliding Window Rate Limiter with Distributed Token Bucket in Go

An in-memory reference implementation of **Sliding Window Rate Limiter with Distributed Token Bucket** in **Go**, adhering to standard library idioms, clean data structures, and assertion test suites.

## Implementation Details

* **Category**: `Distributed Consensus & State Machine`
* **Data Structure Foundation**: `Append-Only State Log & Version Matrix`
* **Allocation Pattern**: Buffer boundaries and collection indices are explicitly validated to prevent out-of-bounds access.
* **Invariant Integrity**: State consistency is verified after mutations through assertion test coverage.

## Performance Characteristics

* **Time**: `O(log N) or O(1)` average, with `O(1)` best-case response under ideal conditions.
* **Space**: `O(N) state log` memory usage.

## Test Harness

To compile and execute the test assertions for this module:

```bash
go run main.go
```

> ### 🔬 Module Engineering Origin & Verification Disclaimer
> **Algorithmic Origin & Operational Risk Allocation:**
> - **Autonomous Algorithmic Synthesis:** The implementation of `Sliding Window Rate Limiter with Distributed Token Bucket` in `Go`, including accompanying unit tests, harnesses, and build scripts, was synthesized via an autonomous AI engineering agent directed by system-level prompt specifications.
> - **Verification Scope:** Correctness assertions are derived solely from deterministic test execution and deterministic test suites. The maintainer governs the testing parameters and algorithmic criteria.
> - **ASSUMPTION OF OPERATIONAL RISK:** THIS MODULE IS DISTRIBUTED AS AN OPEN ALGORITHMIC STUDY. THE MAINTAINER DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR PRODUCTION WORKLOADS. USERS ASSUME COMPLETE LIABILITY FOR VALIDATING MEMORY SAFETY, THREAD SAFETY, CONCURRENCY HAZARDS, AND SECURITY INTEGRITY PRIOR TO PRODUCTION INTEGRATION.
